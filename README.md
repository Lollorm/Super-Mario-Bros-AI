An AI agent trained with the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm successfully beating Level 1-1  
(Even going as far as learning a frame/pixel perfect glitch called 'wall jump')

Best fitness over generations

## Environment

The Gym Super Mario Bros environment was used to provide the game interface and training environment for the agent. Documentation can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/gym-super-mario-bros/).

## NEAT implementation

### About NEAT

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm used to evolve artificial neural networks. It gradually optimizes both network structure and weights through evolutionary processes. A full description of the algorithm is available in the original [paper](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).  
In this project, NEAT is implemented using the NEAT-Python library. The official documentation can be found [here](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


### Requirements

```
pip install gym-super-mario-bros
```
